Unreal 4 learning Project "Store Escape"

In the game "Store Escape" you are locked in a curious and somewhat abandond store.
You can already see the keys to the front door. You could crawl to them but you don't want to get dirty.
Time to find an other way...

This is my first Unreal Project. I created it to get into the Unreal Engine.
